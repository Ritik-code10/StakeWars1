It aims to provide a foundation for learning and expanding decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- Users can **stake Ether** into the contract.
- A **reward calculation system** based on a fixed percentage.
- Ability to **withdraw both stake and rewards** at any time.
- Transparent and fully on-chain smart contract logic.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
- Support for **ERC20 tokens** instead of only Ether.
- **Dynamic reward rates** based on staking time or pool size.

- A **front-end DApp interface** for easy interaction.
- **Governance features** to allow users to vote on reward policies.
